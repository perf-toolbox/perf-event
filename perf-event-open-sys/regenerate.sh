# Adding a new architecture
# =========================
# In order to add bindings for a new architecture you will need the arch name
# as used in
# - the linux architecture name,
# - the rustc target triple, and,
# - the clang target triple.
#
# For some architectures (e.g. x86_64) this will all be the same. For others,
# (e.g. RISC-V) they will all be different.
#
# Here's how to find each one:
# - For rustc, look at the supported target triples in the documentation here:
#   https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/rustc/platform-support.html
# - Linux has its own architecture naming scheme. See the page below for a
#   command which generates a list:
#   https://docs.kernel.org/kbuild/headers_install.html
# - For Clang, there doesn't seem to be one place that lists all of the
#   supported architectures. It may be necessary to do some research here.
#   A small list is available at:
#   https://clang.llvm.org/docs/CrossCompilation.html#target-triple
#
# Once you have these, add a new gen_bindings command that passes in the arch
# names.
#
# As an example, the command for riscv64 would look like this:
#
#    gen_bindings riscv64gc riscv riscv64
#
# Updating the linux kernel version
# =================================
# The full kernel version used is specified right here:
version=6.3.2
#
# In order to generate bindings for a different kernel change the version and
# rerun the script. See https://kernel.org/ to find available kernel versions.
# This script will take care of downloading the new kernel tarball, extracting
# it, and then using that kernel to generate the bindings.
